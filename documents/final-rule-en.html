    <h2>Outline</h2>
    <p>
      The final round tournament is organized as a single-elimination
      knockout tournament with 16 participating teams, with an additional
      third-place playoff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the tournament matches consists of two games on the same
      game field exchanging the initial positions of the agents.  When
      the match is a draw, an extra match with a different game field
      is played.  When the extra match is a draw again, the team seeded
      higher will proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tournament is conducted as shown in the bracket on the
      right.  The numbers in squares are the seeding ranks of the
      participating teams.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Fields</h2>
    <p>
      The game field for each match of the final round is picked among
      those listed in the web page of the contest before the preliminary
      round, after altering the positions and amounts of hidden treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game fields satisfy the following.
      <ul>
	<li>The field size is at least 6x6 and at most 12x12</li>
	<li>The maximum number of steps in a game 100</li>
	<li>Think time limit is 10,000 milliseconds for each agent</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Seeding</h2>
    <p>
      Seeding is based on team ranks resulting from the preliminary
      round tournament.  When more than one team is ranked the same,
      the seed order is decided by drawing lots.
