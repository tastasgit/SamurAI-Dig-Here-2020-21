	This document gives the rules of the <em>SamurAI Dig Here
	  2020</em> game, played in the programming contest <em>SamurAI
	  Coding 2020-21</em> organized by Information Processing
	Society of Japan.
      </p>

    <h2>Game Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The game is a zero-sum game with imperfect information,
      played by two teams each with two player agents controlled by
      programs provided by the contestants.
      The objective of the game is to dig out as much treasure buried in
      the game field as possible.
    </p>

    <img src="screenShots/small-field.png" width="50%" class="figure">
    <h3>Game Field</h3>
    <p>
      The game field has a square shape, divided into small squares
      called <em>cells</em> aligned in a square lattice.  The size of
      the game field, that is, the number of cells in one side of the
      field may differ from one game to another.  The minimum size is
      six the maximum is twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure to the right is a bird’s eye view of the square game
      field from a diagonal direction.
    </p>

    <h3>Game Agents</h3>
    <p>
      Both teams have two agents each, one <em>samurai</em> and
      one <em>dog.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Game agents are controlled by programs provided by the
      contestants.  A single program is run as two separate processes,
      one for controlling the samurai and one for the dog of a team.
      They share only those information provided by the game
      management system.  No other communication is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the game starts, agents are positioned in some distinct cells
      in the field.  More than one agents cannot be in the same cell at
      a time throughout a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one step of a game, a dog agent can move to one of the eight
      neighboring cells, that is, those cell that share one or two
      corners with the cell the dog is in.  Samurai agents can move to
      any of the eight neighboring cells in the very first step of a
      game and steps immediately following one taking a rest, but in
      other steps, they can move only to one of the four neighboring
      cells, that are, those cells that share an edge, and diagonal
      moves to other four cells are not possible.  They can also stay
      in the cell they are in.
    </p>
    <p>
      When planned plays are not viable, for example, when two or more
      agents are instructed to move to the same cell, none of the
      agents can make their moves and all such agents are kept in
      their original positions.  Details are described in the
      section <a href="#viability">Viability Judgment
      Procedure</a> below.
    </p>

    <h3>Holes</h3>
    <p>
      Some of the cells in the field may have a <em>hole</em> in them,
      preventing game agents to step into.  A samurai agents can,
      however, instead of making a move, plug a hole in one of the
      neighboring cells.  Samurai can also dig new holes in one of the
      neighboring cells.  The cell to dig/plug a hole can be any of
      the eight neighboring cells in a step immediately taking a rest;
      otherwise the target cell is limited to one of four neighboring
      cells.  Digging a new hole is not possible if another agent is
      already in the cell or moves to the cell in the same step.
    </p>
    <p>
      No holes are in the cells where agents are initially in.
    </p>

    <h3>Buried Treasures</h3>
    <p>
      Some of the cells in the field may have <em>buried treasure</em> in them.
      Digging a new hole in a cell with buried treasure digs it out.
      If samurai of both teams dig a hole in the same cell in the same step,
      the treasure dug out is halved and shared by the two teams.
      The amounts of buried treasure are always an even number,
      and the total of the buried treasure does not exceed 10<sup>9</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dog in one of the eight neighboring cells of the cell with
      buried treasure can sense the position as well as its amount, but
      they are <em>not</em> informed to the rest of agents.
      Dogs bark when they step into a cell with buried treasure,
      making the treasure position and its amount known to <em>all</em>
      the other agents.
      Not only the colleague samurai but also the opponent samurai
      and the opponent dog hear the bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treasures are not buried in the initial positions of agents
      nor in the cells with holes.
    </p>

    <h3>Game Steps</h3>
    <p>
      A game is played in a step-wise manner.  When a game step
      starts, all the agents make their <em>play plans</em> of the
      step simultaneously.  The play plans are checked their validity
      and also collated to detect conflicts between them, resulting in
      a set of <em>actions</em> the agents can actually take.  The
      actions are then carried out and the field state is updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Game steps are repeated until the predefined maximum number of
      steps are played or all the buried treasures have been excavated.
    </p>

    <h2>Player Programs</h2>
    <h3>Player Processes</h3>
    <p>
      The contestant should provide a <em>player program</em> for
      controlling two agents, a samurai and a dog, belonging to the
      team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game management system starts two <em>player processes</em>
      for each of the two teams.  The two player processes of one
      teams execute the same program, one of which controls the
      samurai and the other the dog of the team.  Which agent to
      control is informed by the game management system after the
      processes are started.
    </p>
    <p>
      The player processes have no direct communication paths between
      them; the only communication possible is with the game
      management system.
    </p>

    <h3>Input and Output</h3>
    <p>
      At the start of each of the game step,
      the game management system sends information on the game state
      to those player processes.
      Each player process should receive the information and respond with
      a play plan for the corresponding agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game state information sent from the game manager can be read
      from the standard input of the player process.
      The play plan in its response should be sent to the standard output.
    </p>

    <h3>Play Plans and Actions</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>play plans</em> are the plans of agents' plays sent by the
      player programs, and the <em>actions</em> are the plays actually
      taken by the agents decided by the game management system after
      validity and conflict checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play plans are called <em>invalid</em> if the plan can be judged
      to be impossible with the state of the field.  Play plans that
      might have been possible only considering the state of the
      field, but have been made impossible because of conflicts with
      moves of other agents are called <em>not viable.</em>
      For example, if an agent plans to move to a cell with a hole in
      it, the plan is invalid.  On the other hand, if two agents' play
      plans tell to move to the same cell, their plans conflict with each
      other and thus are not viable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play plans are not carried out when they are invalid or not
      viable.  The difference is that invalid play plans are
      treated the same as a play plan specifying to take
      a <em>rest</em>.  Valid but not viable play plans are recorded
      as they are in the play plan items in the game state information
      sent to the agents in the next step, while an invalid play plan
      is recorded as taking a rest.  This prevents information
      exchange between agents by specifying an invalid plan.  This
      also enables the samurai's moves to or digs/plugs in the
      diagonally neighboring cells in the directly following step,
      the same as taking a rest is specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of play plans and actions is represented as an
      integer <var>m</var> (-1 &leq; <var>m</var> &leq; 23), meaning
      the following.
      <div class="figure">

	<dt>16, &hellip;, 23</dt>
	<dd>Plug the hole in one of the neighboring cells.</dd>
      </dl>
      The coordinates of the target cell, that is the agent moves to or
      the cell to dig or plug a hole, is indicated by <var>d</var>
      &equals; <var>m</var> modulo 8.
      The neighboring cells designated by <var>d</var> are
      shown in the table to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dogs cannot dig or plug a hole.
      A play plan of a dog less than &minus;1 or greater than 7
      is <em>invalid.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving to, or trying to dig or plug a hole outside of the field,
      digging a hole in a cell already with a hole or plugging a
      non-existent hole, and moving to or digging/plugging a hole in a
      cell where another agent is in at the start of a step are
      all <em>invalid.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Valid play plans can be judged <em>not viable</em> due to
      conflicts with other agents' play plans.  Details are
      described in the next section.
    </p>
    <h3 id="viability">Viability Judgment Procedure</h3>
    <p>
      Play plans are judged invalid, viable, or not viable according
      to the following procedure, applied in this order.
      <dl>
	<dt>Elimination of invalid plans</dt>
	<dd>
	  Invalid play plans are regarded the same as taking a rest.
	</dd>
	<dt>Crossing move lines</dt>
	<dd>
	  When diagonal play plans of two agents, moving, digging or
	  plugging a hole, cross their move lines, if both agents are
	  samurai are both are a dog, their plans are not viable.  If
	  one is a samurai and the other is a dog, the dog's plan is
	  not viable.
	</dd>
	<dt>Move collision</dt>
	<dd>
	  Multiple agents' plans of moving to the same cell are not viable.
	</dd>
	<dt>Digging a hole at the move destination of another agent</dt>
	<dd>
	  When another agent moves to the cell in which a samurai
	  plans to dig a hole, the digging plan is not viable.
	</dd>
      </dl>
      Plans judged not viable for the reasons listed above
      are neglected in viability judgment of other plans.
      Thus the following hold.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  When a move plans of two agents are judge not viable as
	  their move lines cross each other, the third agent can move
	  to the destination of the planned but disabled moves.
	</li>
	<li>
	  When plans to move to the same destination of two or more
	  agents are not viable, plans of other agents to dig a hole
	  in that cell are viable.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="figure" style="width:30%; margin:1%">
      <img src="viability.png" width="100%">
      <center>
	<caption>Viability Judgment Example</caption>
      </center>
    </div>
    <p>
      Assume that agents are positioned as shown in the figure to the
      right and the following play plans are indicated.
      <ul>
	<li>Red samurai: Move south east (7)</li>
	<li>Red dog: Move north west (5)</li>
	<li>Blue samurai: Dig a hole in the west cell (10)</li>
	<li>Blue dog: Move north east (3)</li>
      </ul>
      According to the above-described procedure, viability of the
      play plans are judged as follows.
      <ul>
	<li>All the play plans are valid.</li>
	<li>
	  The move lines of the red samurai and the blue dog cross.
	  As samurai has priority over dog,
	  the blue dog's plan is judged not viable.
	</li>
	<li>
	  As the blue dog's plan is not viable, the move of the red
	  dog to the same destination is judged viable.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The blue samurai's plan to dig a hole to the destination of
	  the red dog is judged not viable.
	</li>
      </ul>
      In conclusion, plans of red agents are both viable while
      neither of the plans of blue agents is viable.
    </p>      
    <h3>Game State Information</h3>
    <p>
      The game state information sent from the game management system to
      the player processes at the beginning of each step contains the
      following items, in this order.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The agent ID of the agent controlled by the player
	  process receiving the information.
	  0 for one of the samurai, 1 for its opponent samurai,
	  2 for the friend dog of the samurai numbered 0,
	  and 3 for the opponent dog.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Field size, that is, the number of cells in one side of the
	  field (integer).
	</li>
	<li>
	  Current game step number (integer).
	  The step number starts with 0.
	</li>
	<li>Maximum number of game steps (integer).</li>
	<li>
	  List of positions of cells with holes.
	</li>
	<li>
	  List of buried treasures already known to all the agents.
	  Treasures already excavated are not in the list.
	</li>
	<li>
	  For a dog agent, list of the buried treasures in eight
	  neighboring cells and not made known to all the agents.
	  For a samurai agent, an empty list.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Positions of the four agents, in the order of agent numbers.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Play plans of the agents in the previous step, in the order
	  of agent numbers.  As stated above, invalid play plans
	  are recorded as &minus;1.  For the first step of a game, all
	  will be &minus;1.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Actions taken by the agents in the previous step, in the
	  order of agent numbers.  For the first step of a game, all
	  will be &minus;1.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Scores, that are, the total amount of treasure already dug
	  out by the previous step (two integers).  The score of the
	  team of agents 0 and 2 comes first, followed by that of the
	  opponent team.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The total amount of treasure not excavated yet (an integer).
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="#timeLimit">Think time</a> left (an integer in milliseconds).
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      All the items in the game state information are given as
      integers.  A newline is placed between the items in the itemized
      list above, and when two or more integers in an item, they are
      separated by a space.  A newline follows the last item.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the items describes as <em>lists</em> above start with the
      number of items in the list (an integer).  For an empty list, it
      is 0.  Descriptions of items in the list, if any, follow it.
      Each item may consist of one or more integers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Positions of cells are represented by two integers,
      meaning the x- and y-coordinates of the cell.
      The coordinate values are non-negative integers less than the field size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buried treasures are represented by three integers.
      The first two of them are the coordinates of the cell the treasure
      is buried in, and the third is the amount of the treasure,
      which is an even positive integer.

      An example of game state information is shown in the figure on
      the right.  The notes beginning with "//" are for explanation
      here and are not actually sent to player processes.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  This information is sent to for player ID 3, the dog of one team.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The field consists of ten by ten cells.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The game step number is 1.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The maximum number of steps is 100 in this game.
	</li>
	<li>
	  There are 6 cells with a hole in them, located at
	  coordinates (5, 1), (7, 3), (7, 0), (8, 1), (6, 0), and (5, 2).
	</li>
	<li>
	  There is one publicly known buried treasure at (6, 6) with
	  the amount of 6.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The dog agent this information is sent detected hidden
	  treasure at (2, 7) of the amount of 8.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The four agents are at (9, 6), (2, 4), (5, 3), and (1, 6).
	</li>
	<li>
	  The play plans of the agents in the previous step were 0, 0,
	  7, and 7.  As the play plans of both samurai agents are not
	  &minus;1, their play plans of diagonal moves and
	  digging/plugging would be invalid.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The actions taken by the agents in the previous step were 0,
	  0, 7, and 7, that is, all the plans were carried out as
	  specified.
	</li>
	<li>
	  No treasure has been dug out yet.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The total amount treasure yet to be dug out is 50.

	<li>
	  The think time left for this agent is 299941 msec.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Play Plans</h3>
    <p>
      In response to the game state information received,
      the player program should send a play plan
      for the correspondent agent.
      The play plan is an integer with the meaning described above.
      A newline should follow the play plan.
    </p>

    <h3 id="timeLimit">Think Time Limit</h3>
    <p>
      A limit is set on the total think time of player processes.
      The think time is the period of time between when the game
      state information is sent to the player process and when its
      response, a play plan, is received by the game management system.
      Note that it is wallclock time rather than CPU time.
      The think time of each step is accumulated and the limit is set on
      the total.
    </p>
    <p>
      The think time limit is set for each of the player processes;
      think times of the samurai and the dog of the same team are
      accumulated independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this time limit is exceeded, the player process is assumed
      to respond with &minus;1 (take a rest) for all the remaining
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value of the think time limit is given for each game.
    </p>

    <h2>Match</h2>
    <p>
      One match between two teams consists of two games with the
      same initial configuration except that the initial positions of
      the agents are swapped between two teams.
      The result of the match is judged by the total amounts of
      treasure dug out in two games.
