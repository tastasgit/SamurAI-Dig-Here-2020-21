      <p>
	The <em>SamurAI Dig Here 2020</em> game manager is a tool to play
	games of <em>SamurAI Dig Here 2020</em> between player agent
	programs and generates log of the games.
      </p>
    </center>

    <h2>Functionalities</h2>
    <p>
      The SamurAI Dig Here 2020 game manager is for the following.
      <dl>
	<dt>Playing games:</dt>
	<dd>
	  Given a game field configuration, a game by between two
	  player player agent programs can be played, writing out the
	  play log of the game.
	</dd>
	<dt>Generating communication logs:</dt>
	<dd>
	  During games,
	  copies of the data sent from the manager to player agent
	  programs can be saved to an external file,
	  which may be useful for debugging player agent programs.
	</dd>
	<dt>Verifying play logs:</dt>
	<dd>
	  A play log file given can be checked for its consistency.
	</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The command line should be in the following format.
      <pre>
./manager [<em>options</em>] &lt;<em>log</em>&gt; [&lt;<em>script1</em>&gt; &lt;<em>script2</em>&gt; [&lt;<em>script3</em>&gt; &lt;<em>script4</em>&gt;]]
      </pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Game Field</h3>
    <p>
      The argument &lt;<em>log</em>&gt; is a path to a file describing the
      game field configuration and (possibly empty) play logs on the
      field.  This file is usually prepared with
      <a href="help.html"> the SamurAI Dig Here 2020 web page</a> with the
      file name extension "<tt>.dighere</tt>".
    </p>
    <h3>Player Programs</h3>
    <p>
      When all of the arguments &lt;<em>script1</em>&gt; through
      &lt;<em>script4</em>&gt; are omitted, the manager checks the
      consistency of the log file.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all of &lt;<em>script1</em>&gt; through &lt;<em>script4</em>&gt; are
      given, they are interpreted as paths to the shell script to launch
      player agent processes.
      &lt;<em>script1</em>&gt; and &lt;<em>script2</em>&gt; are for samurai
      while &lt;<em>script3</em>&gt; and &lt;<em>script4</em>&gt; are for dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When only &lt;<em>script1</em>&gt; and &lt;<em>script2</em>&gt;
      are given, they are used also for launching processes for dogs.
      In this case, two distinct player agent processes of a team, one
      for samurai and another for a dog, are launched with the same
      script.  Whether a process controls a samurai or a dog can be
      known by the information the manager sends to the player
      processes.
    </p>
    <h3>Options</h3>
    <p>
      The following options are available.
      <dl>
	<dt><tt>-S</tt>:</dt>
	<dd>
	  Output summary of each game step played to the standard error.
	  The summary consists of the following lines.
	  <div class="exampleText">
	    <pre>
Step: 66
Agent 0@(0,5) move (0,6)  9330 msec left
Agent*1@(1,7) move (2,8)  7941 msec left
Agent 2@(1,8) move (2,7)X 9340 msec left; Crossing move lines
Agent 3@(0,4) move (1,5)  7785 msec left
Scores are 223:103
	    </pre>
	  </div>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      The step number of the game step.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Information on apparent treasures:
	      their amounts and positions.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The positions, play plans, and think time left of four agents,
	      one line for each agent.
	      The agent number is prefixed with an asterisk <tt>*</tt>
	      if the agent had taken a rest in the previous step
	      and thus plays to diagonal directions were valid.
	      The coordinates of cell planned to move to, dig up, or fill up
	      are also displayed.
	      When the plan cannot be actually taken for the plan
	      was invalid or not viable,
	      it is followed by an <tt>X</tt> to indicate it,
	      and the point of inappropriateness of the plan
	      is explained at the end of the line.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Scores of both teams up to this step.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  An example is shown in the figure on the right.
	</dd>
	<dt><tt>-D &lt;<em>path</em>&gt;</tt></dt>
	<dd>
	  Copies of the data send from the manager to player programs
	  are saved in to the files with specified path.  As there are
	  four agents, the output goes to four files with paths
	  generated by appending agent IDs to the &lt;<em>path</em>&gt;
	  specified.
	  The IDs are the following.
	  <table>
	    <tr><td>0:</td><td>Samurai of player 1</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>1:</td><td>Samurai of player 2</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>2:</td><td>Dog of player 1</td></tr>
	    <tr><td>3:</td><td>Dog of player 2</td></tr>
	  </table>
	</dd>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <h2>Player Processes</h2>
    <p>
      Player programs are run as children processes of the manager.
      Two processes each for both teams, one controlling the samurai
      and the other controlling the dog.  In the tournament, they run
      the same program.  Which agent is to controlled can be known by
      the data sent from the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the processes is given game status data from the
      standard input stream in each game step.  It should respond with
      a play plan for the step.  Further details can be found in the
      document <a href="rules.html">SamurAI Dig Here 2020 Game Rules</a>.
